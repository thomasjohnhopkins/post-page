# Posts on a Page

A static HTML page that allows users to add, edit, and delete posts.

## Features
- A Post component that has a Title text input and a Content text field input that limits input to 300 characters.
- A Preview component that shows a Markdown preview of the Post component's content as you type it.
- A PostList component that shows a list of saved post titles. Clicking on a title restores the post Title and Content into the Post and Preview elements.
- Two buttons below the Post component that allow you to Save or Discard. Save should add the post to the PostList or update an already saved post. Discard should clear the input and delete the post from the PostList.
